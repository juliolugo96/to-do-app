# TO DO App Assessment

*If you are a React coder, use React. Otherwise, code in the JS framework of your choice.*

Make a frontend-only todo list app.

- It has three vertical lists. **Todo**, **Doing**, and **Done**
- Make a fetch call to the Rick and Morty GraphQL API: https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql.  
- Items are created via a form (they can be stored in local state, no need to have a backend).
- Each item in your list must have a character assigned to it.
- Items are draggable from one list to another.
- Items can be reordered within a list
- When you drag an item into the Done list, confetti explodes on the screen! Or something else interesting. You can use a package for this.
- Overall the app has a usable design with a unique color palette. You are free to make whatever UI and UX decisions you want to make it usable. Don't worry, we aren't looking for a groundbreaking innovative design. Just lay things out decently and add some colors.
